## Overview

This course focuses on creating mathematical models from real problems and shows how to optimize them. We have learned how to convert mathematical models into the AMPL language (through the Amplide IDE), which allows them to be automatically solved. I have uploaded some assignments carried out

## Usability

- Copy the exercise folders into Amplide's "models" folder
- Through Amplide enter the exercise folder and execute `include name.run;`
