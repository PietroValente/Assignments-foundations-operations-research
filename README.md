## Overview

Throughout this course, I learned the mathematical language of optimization models and some important classes of models. I also gained an understanding of the main properties and algorithms for graph optimization problems, such as minimum cost spanning tree, shortest path, and maximum flow, as well as the critical path method for project scheduling.

One of the skills that I acquired in this course was the ability to create mathematical models from real-world decision problems and transform these models into the AMPL language using the Amplide IDE. This allowed me to automatically solve the optimization problems using state-of-the-art solvers. In addition, I learned how to apply the LP method to textbook examples, as well as construct the dual of LP problems in explicit and parametric form.

Furthermore, I learned about the main characteristics of Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problems and studied ILP methods, such as the Branch-and-Bound method and the cutting plane method with fractional Gomory cuts, which I applied to small examples.

Through these assignments and projects, I developed the learning skills to tackle complex decision-making problems with a solid mathematical and algorithmic approach, which can be adapted and extended to deal with a variety of real-world problems. Overall, this course provided me with a strong foundation in Operations Research and optimization, which I can leverage to answer simple and complex questions in the future.

## Usability

- Copy the exercise folders into Amplide's "models" folder
- Through Amplide enter the exercise folder and execute `include name.run;`
